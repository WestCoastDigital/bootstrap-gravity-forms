bootstrap-gravity-forms
=======================

Drop in function to add Bootstrap 3 support to Gravity Forms

###What this plugin does:
* Takes your current gravity forms and converts them to Bootstrap 3 syntax
* Eliminates the need for gravity forms css output
* Reduces HTTP requests by not loading gravity form CSS
* Runs on every form rendering, works on ajax forms as well
* Includes support for radio buttons, checkboxes, multiple forms per page, ajax, html5 required attribute, multi-page forms, validation messages, and progress bars
* Speeds up your website or app
* Speeds up development time when using gravity forms and Bootstrap syntax/ styles

###How to use
Just add bootstrap-gravity-forms.js anywhere in your page, or you can copy the function and paste it into your own js file. It will run automatically, on each form rendering.

Disable css output in gravity forms settings if you wish to use Bootstrap styles only

###Notes
This plugin requires jQuery to be loaded before running. If you are using Wordpress, it is already set for noConflict compatibility.
